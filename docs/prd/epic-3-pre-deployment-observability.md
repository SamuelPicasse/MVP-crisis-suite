# Pre-Deployment Observability Enhancement - Brownfield Epic

## Epic Goal

Enable comprehensive debugging and monitoring capabilities across the Crisis Suite system to provide detailed visibility into user actions, API calls, database operations, and system state changes for effective troubleshooting before production deployment.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Basic console.error logging in ActivityLog component, minimal error handling across React components
- Technology stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Supabase client, React hooks, TailwindCSS
- Integration points: Supabase RPC calls, client-side state management, activity logging system, real-time dashboard updates

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Structured logging system with debug levels, API call tracing, user action tracking, performance monitoring, and debugging dashboard
- How it integrates: Wraps existing Supabase calls, instruments React components, extends activity log system with debug data
- Success criteria: Complete traceability of user actions through system, sub-200ms debugging query performance, zero impact on existing functionality

## Stories

1. **Story OBS.1: Core Logging Infrastructure** - Create centralized logging service with configurable levels and integrate with existing Supabase client wrapper
2. **Story OBS.2: User Action & API Call Instrumentation** - Instrument all user interactions (BOB entries, task creation, communications) and database operations with detailed logging
3. **Story OBS.3: Debug Dashboard & Performance Monitoring** - Build admin-accessible debugging interface with real-time logs, API performance metrics, and system health indicators

## Compatibility Requirements

- ✅ Existing APIs remain unchanged (logging wraps, doesn't replace)
- ✅ Database schema changes are backward compatible (new debug tables only)
- ✅ UI changes follow existing patterns (debug dashboard uses current design system)
- ✅ Performance impact is minimal (async logging, configurable levels)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Logging overhead impacting application performance or user experience
- **Mitigation:** Async logging with batching, configurable debug levels, performance monitoring during implementation
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flags for logging levels, ability to disable instrumentation via environment variables

## Definition of Done

- ✅ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Existing functionality verified through testing (all current tests pass)
- ✅ Integration points working correctly (activity log, dashboard, BOB model, tasks)
- ✅ Documentation updated appropriately (debug configuration, troubleshooting guide)
- ✅ No regression in existing features (automated testing confirms)

## Epic Priority

**High Priority** - Must be completed before deployment to ensure adequate debugging capabilities for production troubleshooting.

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies
- Builds incrementally on existing system
- Each story depends on completion of the previous story

## Timeline

- **Story OBS.1:** 1-2 development sessions (core infrastructure)
- **Story OBS.2:** 2-3 development sessions (comprehensive instrumentation)
- **Story OBS.3:** 1-2 development sessions (debug dashboard)
- **Total Epic:** 4-7 development sessions

## Success Metrics

1. **Complete Observability:** 100% of user actions and API calls logged
2. **Performance:** <200ms impact on any user interaction
3. **Debugging Efficiency:** Ability to trace any user issue within 5 minutes
4. **Zero Regression:** All existing functionality works exactly as before
5. **Pre-Deployment Ready:** System ready for production deployment with full debugging capability
