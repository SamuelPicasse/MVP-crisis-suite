# **Technical Assumptions**

* **Repository Structure:** A **Monorepo** structure is assumed. This will simplify sharing of types and logic between the frontend and backend applications.  
* **Service Architecture:** A **Serverless** architecture (e.g., using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions) is assumed for the backend. This provides scalability and cost-efficiency.  
* **Testing Requirements:** The project requires both **unit and integration tests**. The testing strategy will be detailed in the Architecture Document.
