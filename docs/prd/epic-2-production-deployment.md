# **Epic 2: Production Deployment & Infrastructure**

**Epic Goal:** To establish a complete production-ready deployment pipeline and infrastructure that enables the Crisis Suite MVP to be securely deployed, monitored, and maintained in a live environment with proper CI/CD automation.

## **Story 2.1: Supabase Production Environment Setup**

* **As a** system administrator,  
* **I want** to configure a production Supabase project with proper security policies and environment separation,  
* **so that** the Crisis Suite has a secure, scalable backend infrastructure ready for production use.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. Production Supabase project is created and configured with appropriate naming and organization.  
  2. Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly configured for all database tables.  
  3. Environment variables are securely managed for production, staging, and development environments.  
  4. Database backup and recovery procedures are established and documented.  
  5. API rate limiting and security headers are configured appropriately.

## **Story 2.2: Vercel Production Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline**

* **As a** development team,  
* **I want** to establish automated deployment pipelines with Vercel that handle testing, building, and deploying the Crisis Suite,  
* **so that** we can safely and efficiently deploy updates to production with confidence.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. Vercel project is connected to the GitHub repository with proper branch protection rules.  
  2. Automated CI/CD pipeline runs tests, linting, and builds on every pull request.  
  3. Production deployments are triggered only from the main branch after all checks pass.  
  4. Environment variables are securely configured in Vercel for each deployment environment.  
  5. Database migrations are automatically applied during deployment process.  
  6. Rollback procedures are documented and tested.

## **Story 2.3: Production Monitoring, Security & Operational Readiness**

* **As a** system administrator,  
* **I want** to implement comprehensive monitoring, security measures, and operational procedures,  
* **so that** the Crisis Suite operates reliably in production with proper visibility and incident response capabilities.  
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. Application performance monitoring (APM) is configured to track key metrics and errors.  
  2. Security headers, HTTPS enforcement, and domain configuration are properly implemented.  
  3. Database connection pooling and performance optimization are configured.  
  4. Automated backup procedures are implemented and tested.  
  5. Incident response procedures and monitoring alerts are established.  
  6. Documentation for production operations and troubleshooting is complete.
