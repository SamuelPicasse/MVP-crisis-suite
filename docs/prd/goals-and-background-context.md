# **Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

* Decrease the time from incident report to the first decisive action.  
* Centralize all critical crisis data (assessments, decisions, tasks) into a single system.  
* Enable a user to identify their personal responsibilities within 5 seconds of viewing the dashboard.  
* Provide the entire crisis team with a clear, shared operational picture in real-time.

## **Background Context**

The current process for crisis management relies on fragmented, ad-hoc tools like emails, phone calls, and whiteboards. This leads to communication delays, conflicting information, and a lack of accountability, which introduces significant operational risk. This document outlines the requirements for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Crisis Suite, designed to solve these challenges by creating an integrated, single source of truth for crisis response.
