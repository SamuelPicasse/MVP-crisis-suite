# **User Interface Design Goals**

* **Overall UX Vision:** The user experience will be defined by clarity, speed, and focus. The design will be minimalist and utilitarian, prioritizing information hierarchy and reducing cognitive load for users operating under pressure.  
* **Key Interaction Paradigms:** The interface will rely on standard point-and-click interactions. Linking items in the BOB model may be achieved via a simple "link" button that allows the user to select the target item.  
* **Core Screens and Views:**  
  * Main Dashboard  
  * BOB Model Interface  
  * All Tasks List View  
  * Communication Log View  
  * Responsibility Cards View  
  * Document Viewer  
* **Branding:** The visual style will be clean and professional, mirroring the reference images provided. It will use a light theme with clear fonts. Status indicators (e.g., for tasks, crisis status) should use a simple color code (e.g., green, yellow, red) for at-a-glance understanding.  
* **Target Device and Platforms:** The application will be a responsive web app, designed primarily for use on desktop and tablet screens.
