# Story 3.3: Debug Dashboard & Performance Monitoring

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator and developer,
**I want** an admin-accessible debugging interface with real-time logs, API performance metrics, and system health indicators,
**so that** I can quickly identify and troubleshoot issues before they impact Crisis Management Team operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Create admin-only debug dashboard page accessible via secure route
2. Display real-time log entries with filtering by level, component, and time range
3. Show API performance metrics including response times and success/failure rates
4. Provide system health indicators (database connectivity, response times, error rates)
5. Include search functionality for log entries by correlation ID or user actions
6. Display performance trends and identify potential bottlenecks
7. Ensure debug dashboard has zero impact on main application performance
8. Implement admin authentication check to prevent unauthorized access

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create secure admin debug dashboard page (AC: 1, 8)
  - [ ] Create new admin route `/admin/debug` with authentication check
  - [ ] Implement admin user role verification
  - [ ] Design debug dashboard layout following existing design patterns
  - [ ] Add navigation to debug dashboard for admin users

- [ ] Build real-time log viewer component (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Create log entry display component with structured formatting
  - [ ] Implement filtering by log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
  - [ ] Add component and time range filtering
  - [ ] Create search functionality for correlation IDs and keywords
  - [ ] Add real-time log streaming with auto-refresh

- [ ] Implement API performance monitoring dashboard (AC: 3, 6)
  - [ ] Create performance metrics collection and display
  - [ ] Show API response time charts and trends
  - [ ] Display success/failure rates for each endpoint
  - [ ] Implement performance alert thresholds
  - [ ] Add API call frequency and volume metrics

- [ ] Add system health monitoring (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement database connectivity health checks
  - [ ] Monitor overall system response times
  - [ ] Track error rates and anomaly detection
  - [ ] Create system status indicators with color coding
  - [ ] Add automated health check endpoints

- [ ] Optimize debug dashboard performance (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Implement efficient log querying with pagination
  - [ ] Use React virtualization for large log lists
  - [ ] Add lazy loading for performance charts
  - [ ] Ensure debug operations don't impact main app performance

- [ ] Testing and security validation (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Test admin authentication and authorization
  - [ ] Verify unauthorized users cannot access debug routes
  - [ ] Test performance impact on main application
  - [ ] Validate all debug features work correctly

## Dev Notes

**Admin Authentication Integration:**
- Extend existing authentication system from `/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`
- Add admin role check to user profile/session
- Protect `/admin/debug` route with middleware authentication

**Performance Dashboard Requirements:**
- Charts should show trends over time (last 24h, 7d, 30d)
- Key metrics: avg response time, p95/p99 percentiles, error rates
- Dashboard must be responsive and work on tablet devices

**Integration with Previous Stories:**
- Consume logs from LogService created in OBS.1
- Display instrumentation data collected in OBS.2
- Use correlation IDs for tracing user journeys
- Leverage structured log format for filtering and search

**Design Consistency:**
- Follow existing TailwindCSS patterns from main app
- Use similar component structure as ActivityLog component
- Maintain professional, clean design from existing dashboard

**Security Considerations:**
- Debug dashboard should not expose sensitive user data
- Log entries should sanitize any PII or credentials
- Admin access should be strictly controlled and auditable

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Admin dashboard tests: `apps/web/src/app/admin/debug/*.test.tsx`
- Component tests: `apps/web/components/admin/*.test.tsx`
- Use Vitest with React Testing Library
- Mock admin authentication for testing
- Test unauthorized access scenarios
- Performance tests to verify no impact on main app
- Integration tests for real-time log streaming
