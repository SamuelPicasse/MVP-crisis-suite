# Story 1.1: Project Foundation & User Authentication

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the project structure and a basic user authentication system,
**so that** we have a secure and stable foundation to build the application's features upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo with separate packages for the frontend and backend is created.
2. A basic user login and logout flow is functional.
3. Authenticated users are directed to a placeholder dashboard page.
4. The project includes basic configuration for unit testing.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the foundation story for the project.

### Data Models
The User model is defined as follows [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User]:
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; // UUID
  email: string;
  fullName: string;
  role: string;
}
```

### Database Schema
Initial users table schema [Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql.md#Users-Table]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    full_name TEXT,
    role TEXT
);
```

### File Locations
Based on the unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Frontend application: `/apps/web/`
- Supabase backend: `/apps/supabase/`
- Database package: `/packages/db/`
- UI components: `/packages/ui/`
- Shared configs: `/packages/config/`
- ESLint config: `/packages/eslint-config-custom/`
- TypeScript config: `/packages/tsconfig/`

### Technology Stack
Key technologies to use [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: TypeScript ~5.x, Next.js ~14.x
- Styling: Tailwind CSS ~3.x, Headless UI ~2.x
- State Management: Zustand ~4.x (for future stories)
- Backend: Supabase ~2.x (database, auth, functions)
- Database: PostgreSQL 15.x (managed by Supabase)
- Authentication: Supabase Auth ~2.x
- Testing: Vitest ~1.x, React Testing Library
- Monorepo: Turborepo ~1.x
- CI/CD: Vercel (for future deployment)

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints required for this story. Supabase will auto-generate REST APIs for the users table.

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs - developer should create basic login form and dashboard placeholder using Headless UI and Tailwind CSS.

### Testing Requirements
Testing framework specifications [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Use Vitest ~1.x for unit testing
- Use React Testing Library for frontend component testing
- Create basic test configuration and sample tests

### Technical Constraints
- Must use the exact versions specified in tech stack
- Must follow the monorepo structure exactly as defined
- Authentication must use Supabase Auth, not custom implementation

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables for Supabase integration:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Service role key (backend only, keep secure)

### Error Handling Considerations
- Login form should display validation errors for invalid email format
- Show clear error messages for incorrect credentials
- Handle network errors gracefully with retry options
- Implement loading states during authentication requests
- Redirect to login page if authentication token expires

## Testing
- Test files should be colocated with source files using `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension
- Use Vitest ~1.x as the testing framework
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Ensure basic unit tests are created for authentication components

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Solid foundation implementation with clean monorepo structure and working authentication flow. The code follows TypeScript best practices with proper type safety. Authentication is properly secured using Supabase Auth with RLS policies. All acceptance criteria have been met with functional implementation.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/web/src/app/login/page.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive error handling tests and improved mock structure
  - **Why**: Missing test coverage for login failure scenarios
  - **How**: Tests now verify error display, button disable state, and proper error handling

- **File**: apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.test.tsx  
  - **Change**: Created new test file for dashboard component
  - **Why**: Logout functionality was completely untested
  - **How**: Added tests for logout flow, UI rendering, and placeholder content

- **File**: apps/web/vitest.config.ts
  - **Change**: Removed unnecessary type assertion
  - **Why**: ESLint warning about 'any' type usage
  - **How**: Removed redundant type cast that wasn't needed

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Clean TypeScript code with proper typing
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows monorepo pattern exactly as specified
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Vitest configured with React Testing Library
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Added missing error handling tests for login component
- [x] Created dashboard component tests for logout functionality
- [x] Fixed TypeScript linting issue in vitest config
- [ ] Consider adding retry logic for network failures
- [ ] Add session refresh mechanism for long-lived sessions
- [ ] Create integration tests for full auth flow
- [ ] Add rate limiting on login endpoint

### Security Review

No critical security issues found. Authentication properly implemented using Supabase Auth with:
- Secure password handling
- RLS policies on database
- Environment variables for sensitive config
- Proper session management

### Performance Considerations

Application builds successfully with optimizations. Loading states implemented for better UX. Minor warning about Edge Runtime compatibility with Supabase Realtime can be ignored for current use case.

### Files Modified During Review

- apps/web/src/app/login/page.test.tsx (enhanced)
- apps/web/src/app/dashboard/page.test.tsx (created)
- apps/web/vitest.config.ts (fixed linting)
