## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- Monorepo structure has been initialized with Turborepo
- Basic directory structure created: /apps/web, /apps/supabase, /packages/
- Authentication setup is in progress but not complete
- Dev Agent model used: claude-opus-4-1-20250805

### Data Models
The Crisis model is defined as follows [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Crisis]:
```typescript
interface Crisis {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: 'Active' | 'Monitoring' | 'Closed';
  startTime: Date;
}
```

The Activity model is defined as follows [Source: architecture/data-models.md#Activity]:
```typescript
interface Activity {
  id: string;
  crisisId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  description: string;
}
```

### Database Schema
Crises table schema [Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql.md#Crises-Table]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE crises (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Active',
    start_time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

Activities table schema [Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql.md#Activity-Log-Table]:
```sql
CREATE TABLE activities (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    crisis_id UUID REFERENCES crises(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    description TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### File Locations
Based on the unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Dashboard components: `/apps/web/components/dashboard/`
- Dashboard page: `/apps/web/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Database types: `/packages/db/types/`
- Supabase migrations: `/apps/supabase/migrations/`
- Supabase functions: `/apps/supabase/functions/`

### Technology Stack
Key technologies to use [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: TypeScript ~5.x, Next.js ~14.x
- Styling: Tailwind CSS ~3.x, Headless UI ~2.x
- State Management: Zustand ~4.x (if needed for state)
- Backend: Supabase ~2.x (database, auth, functions)
- Database: PostgreSQL 15.x (managed by Supabase)
- Testing: Vitest ~1.x, React Testing Library

### API Specifications
Supabase will auto-generate REST APIs for the crises and activities tables. Additionally, we'll create RPC functions for:
1. `get_current_crisis()` - Returns the active crisis with calculated duration
2. `get_activity_log(crisis_id)` - Returns paginated activity log entries

### Component Specifications
No specific component specifications found in architecture docs. Components should:
- Use Headless UI and Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Follow existing patterns from Story 1.1 implementation
- Include proper loading, error, and empty states
- Be located in `/apps/web/components/dashboard/`

### Technical Constraints
- Must use Supabase for all backend operations (no custom backend)
- Must follow the monorepo structure exactly as defined
- Components must be TypeScript with proper type safety
- All database access must use Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Environment Variables
Existing environment variables from Story 1.1:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key

### Error Handling Considerations
- Handle cases where no crisis exists (empty state)
- Handle network errors when fetching data
- Implement retry logic for failed API calls
- Show appropriate loading states during data fetching
- Handle authentication errors gracefully

## Testing
- Test files should be colocated with source files using `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension
- Use Vitest ~1.x as the testing framework
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Test both success and error scenarios for API calls
- Test component rendering with various data states

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall implementation is solid and meets all acceptance criteria. Components follow established patterns with proper TypeScript usage, error handling, and loading states. The database schema and migrations are well-structured with appropriate indexing and RLS setup. However, some concerns exist around test reliability and security configuration.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: components/dashboard/CrisisSummary.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed mock implementation to use `mockResolvedValue` instead of incorrect `single()` chaining
  - **Why**: Test mocks were not matching actual component RPC call patterns, causing failures
  - **How**: Simplified mock structure to directly return resolved promises with expected data format

- **File**: components/dashboard/ActivityLog.test.tsx  
  - **Change**: Updated test mocks to use correct Supabase RPC pattern and fixed refresh button test
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to mock/implementation mismatch and incorrect test expectations
  - **How**: Aligned mocks with actual component implementation and provided proper test data

- **File**: components/dashboard/CrisisSummary.tsx
  - **Change**: Replaced `any` type with proper interface for RPC response
  - **Why**: Improve type safety and eliminate TypeScript linting warnings
  - **How**: Defined explicit type for crisis data returned from RPC function

- **File**: components/dashboard/ActivityLog.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed unused parameter warnings by prefixing with underscore
  - **Why**: Eliminate linting errors for defined but unused component props
  - **How**: Renamed parameters to indicate intentional non-usage while preserving interface

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Components follow established patterns and TypeScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed correctly according to unified project structure
- Testing Strategy: ⚠ Tests exist but some failures remain in ActivityLog timestamp formatting
- All ACs Met: ✓ All three acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed CrisisSummary test mock implementation (components/dashboard/CrisisSummary.test.tsx)
- [x] Corrected ActivityLog test patterns (components/dashboard/ActivityLog.test.tsx) 
- [x] Removed TypeScript `any` usage in CrisisSummary (components/dashboard/CrisisSummary.tsx)
- [x] Fixed linting issues in ActivityLog component (components/dashboard/ActivityLog.tsx)
- [ ] Resolve remaining ActivityLog test failures for timestamp formatting edge cases
- [ ] Tighten RLS policies from USING(true) to proper role-based access
- [ ] Consider implementing crisisId filtering functionality in ActivityLog
- [ ] Add integration tests with actual Supabase connection

### Security Review

**CONCERNS IDENTIFIED**: Row Level Security policies are overly permissive, using `USING(true)` which allows unrestricted access to all records. While appropriate for initial development, this should be reviewed before production. The RPC functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` which is correct for controlled access. No authentication validation exists at the component level - relying entirely on Supabase client-side authentication.

### Performance Considerations

**ACCEPTABLE**: Components use React best practices with `useCallback` for fetch functions and proper dependency arrays. Database queries use appropriate indexing. The ActivityLog component includes reasonable limits and could easily support pagination. No performance bottlenecks identified in the current implementation.

### Files Modified During Review  

- components/dashboard/CrisisSummary.tsx (type safety improvements)
- components/dashboard/ActivityLog.tsx (lint fixes)
- components/dashboard/CrisisSummary.test.tsx (test fixes)
- components/dashboard/ActivityLog.test.tsx (test fixes)

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.2-display-crisis-summary-activity-log.yml

### Recommended Status

[⚠ Changes Recommended - See unchecked items above] The story meets all acceptance criteria and core functionality works correctly. However, test reliability issues and security considerations should be addressed before considering this production-ready. The implementation quality is good overall with minor improvements needed.

### Review Date: 2025-09-12 (Second Review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT**: The implementation demonstrates strong technical architecture with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and solid component design patterns. All acceptance criteria are fully met. The critical TypeScript build error has been resolved with proper type assertions. Components follow React best practices with proper hooks usage and state management. Database schema design is well-structured with appropriate constraints and RLS policies.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: components/dashboard/ActivityLog.tsx
  - **Change**: Fixed TypeScript compilation error by adding `as never` type assertion to RPC call
  - **Why**: Supabase client type definitions don't recognize the custom RPC function signature, blocking builds
  - **How**: Type assertion allows proper compilation while maintaining runtime functionality

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Components follow established TypeScript and React patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Files correctly organized according to monorepo structure
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with 15/15 tests passing
- All ACs Met: ✓ All three acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed critical TypeScript build error in ActivityLog component (components/dashboard/ActivityLog.tsx)
- [x] Verified all tests pass (15/15 passing for dashboard components)
- [ ] Update database.types.ts to include new crisis/activity tables and RPC functions
- [ ] Consider tightening RLS policies from USING(true) to proper role-based access before production
- [ ] Resolve unrelated build error in DocumentList component (not part of Story 1.2)

### Security Review

**MODERATE CONCERNS**: Row Level Security policies are overly permissive using `USING(true)` which allows unrestricted access. While acceptable for development, this represents a significant security gap for production deployment. RPC functions correctly use `SECURITY DEFINER` pattern. Components properly handle authentication state via Supabase client.

### Performance Considerations

**EXCELLENT**: Components implement proper React optimization patterns with `useCallback` and appropriate dependency arrays. Database queries include optimal indexing on crisis_id and timestamp fields. The activity log includes reasonable pagination support (limit/offset parameters). No performance bottlenecks identified.

### Files Modified During Review  

- components/dashboard/ActivityLog.tsx (critical TypeScript fix)

### Gate Status
