2. Security headers, HTTPS enforcement, and domain configuration are properly implemented.
3. Database connection pooling and performance optimization are configured.
4. Automated backup procedures are implemented and tested.
5. Incident response procedures and monitoring alerts are established.
6. Documentation for production operations and troubleshooting is complete.

## Dev Notes

### Platform Architecture
From [Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md]:
- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel Platform with global CDN for optimal performance
- **Backend**: Supabase Platform (PostgreSQL, Auth, Edge Functions)
- **Key Services**: Vercel (Frontend Hosting & CI/CD), Supabase (Backend-as-a-Service)
- High availability and real-time capabilities are design requirements

### Tech Stack Context
From [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js ~14.x on Vercel
- **Backend Platform**: Supabase ~2.x
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15.x managed by Supabase
- **Testing**: Vitest & RTL ~1.x, Playwright ~1.x for E2E
- **CI/CD**: Vercel for seamless Git-based deployments

### Security Requirements
From [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]:
- Always verify user authentication before data access
- Use Supabase Auth for all authentication flows
- Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- Never store sensitive data in client-side code
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server side
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages

### Performance Standards
From [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance-standards]:
- **Frontend Performance**:
  - Use React hooks efficiently (avoid unnecessary re-renders)
  - Implement proper loading states
  - Minimize bundle size through proper imports
  - Use Next.js built-in optimizations (Image component, etc.)
- **Database Performance**:
  - Design efficient database queries
  - Use appropriate indexes for frequently queried columns
  - Implement pagination for large datasets
  - Cache frequently accessed data when appropriate
- **Compliance**: Pages must load within 3 seconds on fast connections

### Testing Requirements
From [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]:
- Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Test loading, error, and empty states for components
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Project Structure
From [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Frontend application: `/apps/web`
- Supabase backend: `/apps/supabase`
- Database client: `/packages/db`
- Shared configs: `/packages/config`

### Database Schema Context
From [Source: architecture/database-schema-postgresql.md]:
All tables requiring monitoring:
- users, crises, bob_entries, tasks, communications, activities
- All tables use UUID primary keys
- Foreign key relationships need connection pool optimization
- Array fields (linked_from_ids) may need special indexing

### Previous Story Context
- Story 2.1: Configured production Supabase with RLS policies, backups, and security
- Story 2.2: Set up Vercel deployment with CI/CD pipeline
- This story (2.3) adds the monitoring and operational layer on top of the deployed infrastructure
